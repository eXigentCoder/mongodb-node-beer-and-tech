# Hello World! 0.1 - Terminal

To open up a new Node.js session, simply open a terminal and type:

> node

You are now in the node terminal and can use any supported js/node commands, like:

> console.log("Hello World");

Hit `^C` twice or type `.exit` to exit.

# Hello World! 1.0 - Scripts!

Check out index.js for the source and type:

> Type to run `node index.js`
> Can also use `node index`
> Or `node ./index.js`
> Or `node ./index`
> Or `node ./`
> Or `node .`

This shorthand for referring to a file from the current directory becomes important later on when we want to include other files.
